To you, every wreck was an intriguing spatial puzzle. Squeezing through tight spaces without damaging your exo-suit, you were always the first to find and secure treasures for your crewmates. With tools to cut, pry, and bend hull plates – or set precise charges to separate entire sections – you proved your skill in both reading schematics and the practical art of dismantling wrecks.\nFree Talent: Exo-Specialist<br>Quite some time ago, Ava's grandfather, <a data-href=\"Dacaro Aquilar\" href=\"npc's/dacaro-aquilar.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dacaro Aquilar</a>, was a well renowned explorer and map maker. He led many an expedition and charted large swaths of the Charted Sphere, until one day he disappeared, his crew claiming he was with them one moment and gone the next. Ava remembers Dacaro telling her stories of his adventures and she was enraptured by the tales of exploration and the ancient ruins they found along the way, and from the exact moment of his disappearance, she started dreaming of a maze-like structure.<br>\nWhen <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Dacaro Aquilar\" data-href=\"Dacaro Aquilar\" href=\"npc's/dacaro-aquilar.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dacaro</a> disappeared, his son and Ava's father, Dinan Aquilar lost himself in alcohol and drugs in his sorrow, and he and his family were sent to the Far Colonies to work off the debts he'd accumulated. When Ava was old enough to work, she put her affinity for mapping tunnels to good use in the mines. She worked hard and eventually found her way back to Ship City, where she begged <a data-href=\"Master Moska\" href=\"npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Master Moska</a> to let her explore the Lost Horizon like her grandfather had done.\nAva mostly worked on salvage in the mean time, bringing in anything valuable from wrecked ships, studying blueprints and knowing the exact routes to take for the crew to go in and out with the least resistance.\nThe maze in her dreams never stopped appearing, and Ava spent many nights wandering the halls and tunnels of this place she'd never been. She sketched out maps of the routes she'd taken, and eventually had these tattoo'd onto and around her fore-arms and on her back. Thin lines, seeming like nothing but an abstract jumble to most people who looked at them, but to her a maze she had been dreaming of so long, it had become part of her.Crew Cards4 resultsSort0Filter3PropertiesNewFjFjFjFjFj","aliases":["Ava"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Origin","level":1,"id":"Origin_0"},{"heading":"Profession","level":1,"id":"Profession_0"},{"heading":"Origin","level":1,"id":"Origin_1"},{"heading":"Profession","level":1,"id":"Profession_1"},{"heading":"Specialty","level":2,"id":"Specialty_0"},{"heading":"Backstory","level":1,"id":"Backstory_0"},{"heading":"Other Crew","level":2,"id":"Other_Crew_0"}],"links":["npc's/rada-johuna.html","npc's/rada-johuna.html","npc's/dacaro-aquilar.html","npc's/dacaro-aquilar.html","npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"characters/ava-aquilar.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["assets/ava-aquilar-portrait.html","characters/characters.html"],"createdTime":1761679605809,"modifiedTime":1765887412672,"sourceSize":2910,"sourcePath":"Characters/Ava Aquilar.md","exportPath":"characters/ava-aquilar.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":9,"backlinks":["logs/chapter-0.html","logs/chapter-2.html","logs/chapter-3.html","lore/moska's-note.html","npc's/dacaro-aquilar.html"],"type":"markdown"},"characters/characters.html":{"title":"Characters","icon":"","description":"Crew Cards5 resultsSort0Filter3PropertiesNewFjFjFjFjFjfile nameAva AquilarSpecialtyWreck Diverfile nameDorian GolgayadSpecialtyScholarfile nameKestrelSpecialtyfile nameSelene DaraSpecialtyLighthouse Keeper","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"characters/characters.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762948647365,"modifiedTime":1764673441113,"sourceSize":666,"sourcePath":"Characters/Characters.base","exportPath":"characters/characters.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":10,"backlinks":["the-aquilar-logs.html","characters/ava-aquilar.html","characters/dorian-golgayad.html","characters/selene-dara.html","characters/veronica-buttons.html"],"type":"bases"},"characters/dorian-golgayad.html":{"title":"Dorian Golgayad","icon":"","description":"InfoSecond son of the Golgayad family, one of the five Coriolite families.

Without it, every delve becomes a far riskier and more uncertain venture. Birds have transformed the art of exploring ruins, so much so that few can even recall a time before these strange creatures became the steadfast guardians of Explorers braving the Great Dark.\nFirst encountered in a sealed pod orbiting the dead portal of Arakvarat in the year 112, the species commonly known as Garuda, or in everyday talk simply the Birds, has had a major impact on the fate of the human <a data-href=\"Diaspora\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Diaspora</a>. These creatures that were strangely similar to the flying animals of old Ardha, seemed to have slept for eons, awaiting discovery. But why? After early missteps, where scientists mistakenly believed the Garuda to be simple animals, researchers learned that the Birds had powers that defied explanation. Later research proved a connection to <a data-href=\"The Builders\" href=\"lore/the-builders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Builders</a> and it is indeed hypothesised that the Garuda were left behind by <a data-href=\"the Builders\" href=\"lore/the-builders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Builders</a> as guardians of their legacy. During later trials, it was discovered that the Birds proved uniquely resilient to the Blight and could even repel it for short intervals. With these discoveries, the Navigators Guild and other factions across the Diaspora stopped seeing the Garuda as mere curiosities. Instead, they began to view them as partners, vital to humanity's survival and progress in the vast unknown of the Great Dark. Expeditions were soon routinely assisted by Garuda, and with their powers, hitherto undiscovered routes and ruins were uncovered.Over time, the Garuda have become an integral part of Diaspora culture. Their images decorate walls and temples, and having one at the head of an expedition is considered a blessing, a sign of good luck. Yet, despite their usefulness, the Birds remain a mystery. Why were they sealed away for so long? What are they truly meant for? And most pressing of all - could they be the key to stopping the blight that threatens humanity's future?Garuda birds are not real animals nor native to Ship City. They are in fact bioengineered artifacts encountered during the exploration of Charted Sphere. Even though there are thousands of Birds in the city today they all originate from different ruin sites. Bird handlers call a group of Birds found in the same ruin a batch, often with the suffix of the actual ruin name. The very first batch was the Arakvarat one. Examples of later ones are Red (Red Garden), Xu (Great Vault of Xu) and Sirra (Caves of Sirra). Birds from the same batch can often (but not always) be identified by common traits such as feather structure, wing span, shape, colour, and patterns.<br>The first Garuda to awaken from the Arakvarat batch became one of the most legendary Birds in Ship City’s history. Known as Arak, it was a majestic and powerful creature, resembling a falcon in its full splendor. However, when scientists from the Navigators Guild attempted to anesthetize it for a vivisection, disaster struck. Arak awoke with a piercing shriek and unleashed a devastating energy wave, instantly killing a dozen navigators. From that day, the people of the Diaspora learned that the only way to collaborate with the Birds was through respect. The Arakvarat Falcon went on to join several notable expeditions and was eventually gifted to <a data-href=\"Master Moska\" href=\"npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Master Moska</a> upon the founding of the <a data-href=\"Explorers Guild\" href=\"guilds/explorers-guild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Explorers Guild</a>. Arak still remains at her side, both feared and revered.<br>Birds are a common sight across Ship City, often perched on the shoulders of dignitaries or Explorers, or even flying freely in the Chasm. However there is one place more associated with the Garuda than anywhere else and that is the <a data-href=\"Bird Market\" href=\"locations/ship-city/the-chasm/bird-market.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bird Market</a> located in <a data-href=\"the Chasm\" href=\"locations/ship-city/the-chasm/the-chasm.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Chasm</a>. Here, bird traders, trainers, speculants, and others mingle around scores of small stalls perched on the steep floor of the surrounding grotto. If you have an inquiry regarding a Bird, this should likely be your first stop.<br>The three primary factions using the Birds are the <a data-href=\"Navigators Guild\" href=\"guilds/navigators-guild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Navigators Guild</a>, the <a data-href=\"Coriolites\" href=\"lore/coriolites.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coriolites</a>, and the <a data-href=\"Explorers Guild\" href=\"guilds/explorers-guild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Explorers Guild</a>. Each of these utilise Bird scouts that scour <a data-href=\"Ship City\" href=\"locations/ship-city/ship-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ship City</a> for the most precious Garuda specimen to give them an extra edge. As the Birds are valued so highly, they are heavily regulated by Guild law, and indeed destroying a Garuda is punishable by the strictest sentence possible: a lifetime of exile to the Habanatum system. Still, a thriving black market surrounds the trade of Birds and there are even reports of Garuda hunters tracking, capturing, and sometimes killing Birds that roam free in the lower parts of the city.<br>The Birds are not only essential companions for Explorers, they have also become a fashion symbol for the extremely rich. Being seen with a golden long-tailed Garuda from the Sirra batch, or the purple coat of the very rare Xu batch, is perhaps the ultimate status symbol among the upper strata of <a data-href=\"Ship City\" href=\"locations/ship-city/ship-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ship City</a> society. The <a data-href=\"Coriolites\" href=\"lore/coriolites.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coriolites</a> in particular are famous for their penchant for exotic Garuda, the more rare and impractical the specimen, the better. This use of the Birds as mere status symbols is seen as vulgar by Explorers and Navigators alike, who value the Garuda for their special powers and not their hide. Still, the practice continues.<br>Lesser known is the fact that there are free Birds roaming the lower parts of <a data-href=\"Ship City\" href=\"locations/ship-city/ship-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ship City</a>. These avoid people as much as possible, and especially the Garuda Hunters sent out by the <a data-href=\"Black Toad\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Black Toad</a> to capture valuable specimens. Where they come from is not known, but it is presumed that they are Birds that have been traded on the black market and somehow escaped their former masters. To make the phenomena even more strange; the free Birds seem to thrive together, in a swarm. This goes against all that is known about the Garuda. Some speculate that the free Birds have developed some kind of distributed mass intelligence, but no one knows for sure.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"A Brief History of the Garuda","level":1,"id":"A_Brief_History_of_the_Garuda_0"},{"heading":"Garuda Batches","level":1,"id":"Garuda_Batches_0"},{"heading":"The Arakvarat Falcon","level":2,"id":"The_Arakvarat_Falcon_0"},{"heading":"The Birds &amp; The City","level":1,"id":"The_Birds_&_The_City_0"},{"heading":"A Valuable Companion","level":1,"id":"A_Valuable_Companion_0"}],"links":[".html","lore/the-builders.html","lore/the-builders.html","npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html","guilds/explorers-guild.html","locations/ship-city/the-chasm/bird-market.html","locations/ship-city/the-chasm/the-chasm.html","guilds/navigators-guild.html","lore/coriolites.html","guilds/explorers-guild.html","locations/ship-city/ship-city.html","locations/ship-city/ship-city.html","lore/coriolites.html","locations/ship-city/ship-city.html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/garuda.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765823403509,"modifiedTime":1765887574421,"sourceSize":6053,"sourcePath":"Lore/Garuda.md","exportPath":"lore/garuda.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":42,"backlinks":["characters/kestrel.html","logs/chapter-3.html"],"type":"markdown"},"lore/moska's-note.html":{"title":"Moska's Note","icon":"","description":"A note, written by <a data-href=\"Master Moska\" href=\"npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Master Moska</a>, left with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ava Aquilar\" data-href=\"Ava Aquilar\" href=\"characters/ava-aquilar.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ava</a>'s luggage aboard the <a data-href=\"The Zalos\" href=\"locations/the-zalos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Zalos</a><br><img alt=\"Moska's Note.png\" src=\"assets/moska's-note.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["npc's/ship-city/master-moska.html","characters/ava-aquilar.html","locations/the-zalos.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"lore/moska's-note.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["assets/moska's-note.html"],"createdTime":1765823847536,"modifiedTime":1765894108870,"sourceSize":150,"sourcePath":"Lore/Moska's Note.md","exportPath":"lore/moska's-note.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":43,"backlinks":["logs/chapter-3.html"],"type":"markdown"},"lore/the-builders.html":{"title":"The Builders","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-builders.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765874221652,"modifiedTime":1765887586254,"sourceSize":25,"sourcePath":"Lore/The Builders.md","exportPath":"lore/the-builders.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":44,"backlinks":["lore/garuda.html"],"type":"markdown"},"npc's/ship-city/clemence-dukus.html":{"title":"Clemence Dukus","icon":"","description":"","aliases":["Clemence"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"npc's/ship-city/clemence-dukus.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765218031436,"modifiedTime":1765887620671,"sourceSize":47,"sourcePath":"NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus.md","exportPath":"npc's/ship-city/clemence-dukus.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":47,"backlinks":["logs/chapter-1.html","logs/chapter-2.html","logs/chapter-3.html"],"type":"markdown"},"npc's/ship-city/engine.html":{"title":"Engine","icon":"","description":"Proprietor of <a data-href=\"The Outpost\" href=\"locations/ship-city/aluminum-bay/the-outpost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Outpost</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["locations/ship-city/aluminum-bay/the-outpost.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"npc's/ship-city/engine.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765224680545,"modifiedTime":1765887625734,"sourceSize":54,"sourcePath":"NPC's/Ship City/Engine.md","exportPath":"npc's/ship-city/engine.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":48,"backlinks":["logs/chapter-2.html"],"type":"markdown"},"npc's/ship-city/julia-golgayad-mirmira.html":{"title":"Julia Golgayad Mirmira","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Dorian Golgayad\" data-href=\"Dorian Golgayad\" href=\"characters/dorian-golgayad.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dorian</a>'s aunt.
